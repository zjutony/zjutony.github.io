excerpt: 'Precise posture adjustment of biological cells is a critical prerequisite for downstream micromanipulation tasks such as microinjection and cell surgery. In this study, we present a novel robotic micromanipulation strategy for in-plane orientation adjustment of zebrafish embryonic cells using an imitation learning framework with a mixture of experts strategy (MEIL).
